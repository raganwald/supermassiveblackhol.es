# 2016 Wasdell Academy Valedictorian Address

## Outline

### Introduction

- I am Thomas Braithwaite
  - I have been a student at Wasdell for two years
  - I am graduation from grade six
  - I was a student at Duke of Connaught in Toronto before that
- This is my Valedictoran Address
  - I am going to talk about how Wasdell changed me in two years
  - I am going to talk about how Wasdell will change us for the rest of our life

### My Change

- In public school
  - I was bullied
  - The way they taught did not fit the way I learned
    - Example: They have big classes and I did not get individual attention
- At Wasdell
  - I am surrounded by good people
  - They way they teach fits the way I learn
    - Example: We have small classes and I get individual attention
- My change
  - I am more confident socially:
    - I was bullied
    - I now have good people
    - I understand that I can pick good people to be in my life
  - I am learning so much faster:
    - I was being taught with methods that did not fit me
    - I am now taught with methods that fit me
    - I understand that I can learn, I just have to find the method that fits me properly

### Our Life Ahead

- At Wasdell
  - We are a small group of good people who get along and support each other
  - We learn our own way
- We will be successful after Wasdell
  - We will be around other good people and that we support and who will support us
  - We will keep learning
- The way we'll do that
 - Wasdell has taught us that there are good people, and how to support them and be supported.
   - We have learned the importance of picking our friends
 - Wasdell has taught us that there are many ways to learn, and that some work well for us
   - We have learned that if we are struggling with something, we can pick a better way to learn and that we will succeed.

### Thank You
